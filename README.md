# Emergency Situations Assistant

We made a simple website for the Internet Engineering course at Shahid Beheshti University.

Imagine a natural disaster has happened. The local forces need to know what are the needs in the affected area. This website will help them find out.

There are three types of users: System Admin, Field Agent, and Control Center Agent:

-   **System Admin** takes care of forms and areas. Each _form_ has some fields which Field Agents can fill, and Control Center Agents can see their previous submissions. Each _area_ consists of a polygon and a name. They are used for grouping form submissions by their locations.

-   **Field Agents** can see the list of available forms, and submit each form to the server.

-   **Control Center Agents** can see the list of available forms, and see their submission list by clicking on each of them.
